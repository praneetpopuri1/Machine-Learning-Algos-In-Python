# Machine-Learning-Algos-In-Python
I recreated many Fundamental Machine Learning Algorithms and tasks in Python
using given Machine Learning rescrouses, mostly using the free online text-book Understanding Deep Learning.
I recreated Machine/Deep Learning Algorithms such as:
* Basic Gradient Descent
* Stochastic Gradient Descent
* Nesterov Accelerated Momentum
* Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM)
* Binary Cross Entropy Loss
* Multiclass Cross Entropy Loss
* Least Square Loss
* and More
